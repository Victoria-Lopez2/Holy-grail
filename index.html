</head>
<body>
    <header>
        <p>This header uses static positioning by default, meaning no explicit position property is set so it flows naturally in the document order at the top of the page. It occupies 90% width with margins of 25px on all sides, which displace it inward from the edges and create breathing room. Since static positioning doesn't use properties like top, left, bottom, or right for displacement, the element stays in its normal flow position without overlapping others, ensuring it appears first and centered without any offset adjustments.</p>
    </header>

    <nav>
        <p>This nav uses fixed positioning, which takes it out of the normal document flow and anchors it to the browser window. The top: 170px property displaces it 170px down from the top of the viewport, and left: 35px shifts it 35px from the left edge, positioning it below the header. Fixed positioning works with top and left to create a persistent bar that doesn't scroll with the page content, which is why it remains visible and displaced from the flowing elements, allowing for a fixed navigation area in the Holy Grail layout.</p>
    </nav>

    <div>
        <div class="articles">
            <p>This .articles container uses relative positioning, keeping it in the document flow but allowing for positional adjustments. The left: 30px displaces it 30px to the right from its original static position, and top: 45px moves it 45px down, creating space below the fixed nav. Relative positioning with left and top offsets the element without affecting surrounding elements' flow, which is why the articles inside are displaced to the right and down, forming the left column of the Holy Grail layout without breaking the overall structure.</p>

            <article>
                <p>This article uses relative positioning, remaining in the document flow within the .articles container. The top: 15px property displaces it 15px downward from its default position, stacking it below any preceding content. Relative positioning allows top to create vertical spacing without removing the element from flow, which is why it's displaced down within the container, ensuring articles are separated and contribute to the main content area of the Holy Grail layout.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <p>This second article also employs relative positioning, staying in the flow of the .articles container. The top: 15px displaces it 15px down from its normal position, adding separation from the first article. Relative positioning with top enables precise vertical displacement in the document flow, preventing overlap and ensuring the articles are spaced out in the left column, maintaining the Holy Grail's structured main content without absolute removal from the layout.</p>
            </article>
        </div>

        <aside>
            <p>This aside uses absolute positioning, removing it from the document flow and positioning it relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (the body, as no parent has positioning). The left: 50% places it at 50% from the left edge of the ancestor, right: 10% sets a 10% margin from the right, and top: 235px displaces it 235px down from the top. Absolute positioning works with left, right, and top to place elements precisely anywhere, which is why it's displaced to the right side, creating the sidebar in the Holy Grail layout without affecting other flowing elements.</p>
        </aside>
    </div>

    <footer>
        <p>This footer uses fixed positioning, anchoring it to the viewport and removing it from the document flow. The bottom: 0px property displaces it to the very bottom of the screen, and width: 100% spans the full width. Fixed positioning with bottom ensures it stays fixed during scrolling, displaced from the content flow, which is why it appears at the bottom edge, completing the Holy Grail layout as a persistent footer without interfering with other elements' positions.</p>
    </footer>
